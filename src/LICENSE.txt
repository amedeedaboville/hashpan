This notice applies to all source code within the freerainbowtables project and
may not necessarily apply to specific applications.  It is included as a
catch-all and it is up to any users of this code to confirm licensing for
individual applications which may use only a subset of code mentioned here.

All source code and drived binaries fall primarily under the GNU GPL version 2
license, as found in COPYING.  The clause, "either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version" also applies to most source code and dervied
binaries.

Known exceptions for GPL licensed code include at least:
Public.h (portions)
Public.cpp (portions)

The above referenced files have small bits of code that is from nmap and
explicitly they do not allow any later versions of the license.  You will find
that code enclosed with a note "XXX nmap is GPL2".

Files that are not released under the GPL include at least:
des.h
des_enc.c
des_local.h
des_setkey.c
ecb_enc.c
inttypes.h (C99 standard implementation that is not part of VC++)
libeay32.dll
libeay32.lib
podd.h
pthreadGC2.dll
sk.h
spr.h

inttypes.h (used extensively throughout the project where VC++ windows builds are created) falls under the following licensing terms:
